        <p>I AM A PROFESSIONAL GAME DEVELOPER</p>
        <p>I&#39;m Kervin Amiel Josh K. Canlas, but you can call me &quot;Joro.&quot; I enjoy playing online games with my
friends, and I really like the song &quot;And&quot; by Eden, even though not many people know about it. My top
foods are Shawarma and Pineapple Pizza. I don&#39;t have a lot of social events, but what I love is the fun we
have when we game together. It&#39;s a different kind of fun, unlike always going out or partying.</p>
